###  Mood Music 

Ever get emotional and immediately need a soundtrack to your life? Mood Music curates playlists based on users' emotional states so they have immediate access to songs that'll resonate with their hearts. And because everyone experiences emotions differently, users can personalize each mood by uploading, deleting and adding notes to songs. Power users can create new moods entirely.
